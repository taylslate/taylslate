## I2: Past-campaign parse API

### What was built

`POST /api/deals/import` accepts `mode=past_campaign` (form field or query) and returns drafts only. The branch requires a signed-in brand or agency, same as the save route. CSV and XLSX go through `callLLMWithFallback` and `lib/prompts/past-campaign-mapping.md` to map columns. Past-campaign PDFs call `createLLMClient()` from `lib/llm/client.ts` and pass model `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` explicitly, then `dealsFromImportedIO`. That model matches the older IO PDF path. The older path still constructs its own client and is unchanged.

`POST /api/imports/past-campaigns` saves one `past_campaign_imports` row and its `past_campaign_records` for the signed-in brand or agency. `brand_id` is the session user on both rows (composite FK). A `brand_id` in the body is ignored. `matched_show_id` is an exact case-insensitive show-name hint: one match is stored, zero or several stay empty. The hint is not a write to `shows`.

Limits on parse: 10MB, 2,000 data rows, extension plus MIME. An XLSX is rejected before exceljs loads it when the inflated zip entries exceed 32MB (`lib/imports/xlsx-limit.ts`), including a stream that under-reports its size in the zip header. Save status is `confirmed`. `pooling_consent` defaults to false, and `terms_version` is stored only when consent is true.

### Where

- `lib/imports/csv.ts`
- `lib/imports/xlsx-limit.ts`
- `lib/imports/past-campaigns.ts`
- `lib/imports/fixtures/past-campaign.csv`
- `lib/imports/fixtures/past-campaign.pdf`
- `lib/prompts/past-campaign-mapping.md`
- `app/api/deals/import/route.ts` (new branch only)
- `app/api/imports/past-campaigns/route.ts`
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (`exceljs@4.4.0`, regenerated from the main lockfile). Existing locked package versions are unchanged. Where an exceljs dependency needs a newer copy, that copy is nested under the new package.

### Tests

`npx vitest run lib/imports app/api/deals/import app/api/imports`

Covers CSV, XLSX (first sheet only), and PDF fixtures with a mocked LLM, the old IO response shape, body `brand_id` ignored, and both 054 tables written under the session brand. Supabase is mocked. No live writes.

### Known gaps

- Migration 054 is in the repo and is not applied. Save will fail against the live database until Chris applies it after merge.
- No UI in this job. The older IO PDF and manual JSON paths stay open without a session. `mode=past_campaign` and the save route require a brand or agency session.
- XLSX reads the first worksheet only. A sheet whose dimension is more than 7,000 rows is rejected.
- PDF drafts follow `dealsFromImportedIO`: one row per show, price and downloads taken from the first line item. Conversions are empty because an IO does not carry them.
- `matched_show_id` is a hint. A failed or ambiguous name lookup leaves it empty and still saves the row.
- `exceljs` is imported directly. `next.config.ts` was not changed.
- CSV MIME must be `text/csv`, `application/csv`, `text/plain`, or `application/vnd.ms-excel`. XLSX must be the Open XML sheet MIME. `application/octet-stream` is rejected.

### What was built

An admin-only clickable mockup of the pending screens, so they can be signed off before any of those UI jobs start. Every page checks `isInternalAdmin` on the server and calls `notFound()` otherwise. Data comes from static fixtures. Buttons update React state in the browser only. Every page shows the banner "Mockup. Nothing here is saved."

Surfaces:

- CRM index, with a Free upgrade card. Starter and Operator previews open the show list. `canUseCrm` is mirrored locally as `previewCanUseCrm` (Starter, Operator, and the legacy agency id).
- Per-show CRM: Contacts (add, edit, remove), Notes (add, remove), and read-only Deal history with placement, episodes, CPM, total, and flight.
- Past campaign import: choose CSV, XLSX, or PDF, name a file, edit sample rows, see an advisory catalog suggestion, accept or skip pooling consent (`pooling-v1`), then a confirmed summary. Discard is local too.
- Rep roster: Exclusive starts on and can be turned off. Rep deals for roster links show status and flight only. Per-show view repeats that, plus the exclusive switch. Roster CSV upload parses show names in the browser, previews them as pending with Exclusive on, and can be confirmed locally.
- Roster requests: pending, approved, and rejected, with approve and reject.
- API keys: create with scopes, show the secret once, hide it, revoke, and show last used.
- Approvals: pending actions with approve and reject.

### Where

- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/crm/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/crm`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/crm/[showId]/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/crm/[showId]`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/import/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/import`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/rep/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/rep`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/rep/deals/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/rep/deals`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/rep/shows/[showId]/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/rep/shows/[showId]`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/rep/upload/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/rep/upload`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/roster-requests/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/roster-requests`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/api-keys/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/api-keys`
- `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/approvals/page.tsx` at `/admin/mockups/approvals`
- Fixtures and the admin gate: `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/fixtures.ts`, `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/require-admin.ts`
- Shared Ink & Gold chrome: `app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups/chrome.tsx`

The index is not in the sidebar. `lib/nav/items.ts` was left alone. Open `/admin/mockups` while signed in as an internal admin.

### Tests

`npx vitest run "app/(dashboard)/admin/mockups"` (26 tests).

- `require-admin.test.ts`: signed-out and non-admin sessions 404; an allowlisted email passes. The helper is the real `isInternalAdmin`.
- `mockups.test.tsx`: each route renders the banner, an unknown show id 404s after the admin check, rendered text has no em dash, and the click paths stay local (upgrade card, contact and note, import through consent, exclusive toggle, CSV preview, roster approve/reject, API key shown once then hidden, approval approve/reject). Rep deals render no dollar amounts.

### Known gaps

- Nothing is saved. There is no database read or write, no server action, and no request from these pages. A refresh restores the fixtures.
- The import review always loads sample rows, including after a real file is chosen, so CSV, XLSX, and PDF can be clicked through without a parser. The roster CSV screen does read a chosen text file in the browser.
- The Free upgrade button only switches this preview to Starter. It does not bill.
- The client does not import `lib/entitlements/plan.ts`, because that module opens a server client. `previewCanUseCrm` matches `canUseCrm`.
- Rep deal fixtures have no amount fields, so that screen cannot show CPM, rate, or spend.
- Sidebar entry, real persistence, file parsing for XLSX and PDF, and wiring approve/reject to roster status are later jobs. Migrations 053, 054, and 055 are not applied here. The fixtures follow their column shapes only.
